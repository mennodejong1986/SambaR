# SambaR

SambaR is a R package which allows users to import a biallelic SNP dataset into R and to perform quality control and population genetic analyses with a minimum number (i.e. ≤ 10) of R commands. Summary statistics and analyses outcomes are automatically exported in ready to publish graphs with coherent layout (i.e. consistent font type, font size and colour coding based on population assignment).

The selection scan 'GWDS' is implemented in SambaR.

The easiest way to start using SambaR is to load the script directly from this Github page into R, by typing on the R command line:
source("https://github.com/mennodejong1986/SambaR/raw/master/SAMBAR_v1.xx.txt")   # replace xx with the correct version

However, you will need the manual for further instructions. Therefore, if you are a first-time user, download SambaR from this website using the green 'Code' button (choose 'Download ZIP'), unzip the folder, and follow the instructions in the SambaR manual (which will be included in the download). Note: do NOT use the git clone command, because this will not work. We intend to make this option available at a later point in time. An example dataset is provided in the example dataset directory, which will also be included in the download. Users must agree with the terms of the LICENSE.

UPDATE 08-01-2024

SambaR now also accepts input dataframes with pairwise sequence dissimilarity estimates, for whole-genome distance-based phylogenetics. For further instructions, see:
https://github.com/mennodejong1986/VCF_pairwise_distances

UPDATE 17-11-2023

A bug in the function for relatedness calculations made that SambaR could mark the wrong pair of individuals as closely related. This bug has been fixed in SambaR version 1.10. 

UPDATE 22-04-2021

By default, the calcdiversity() function of SambaR does no longer generate SFS-vectors. Users can still enable this utility, but are adviced to generate SFS vectors using more established methods (e.g., ANGSD, EasySFS or Popgen Pipeline Platform).
